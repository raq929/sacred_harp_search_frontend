## Sacred Harp Search
The front end of an app that allows users to search the Sacred Harp database of minutes.

##HTML-CSS
I built the HTML and CSS for my page using Bootstrap. I used a [Bootstrap tutorial](http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/) to learn about the different features of bootstrap.

Features of Bootstrap I used:
*tabs
*forms

I used a pre-writted form for my [states drop-down menu](https://gist.github.com/RichLogan/9903043).

##JavaScript
I used jQuery to switch between the tabs on the page, and to display data from the database on a table.
